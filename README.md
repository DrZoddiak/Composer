#### This version has been updated to work with Sponge API v7.
Composer is a full featured note block music importer and player. Import Note Block Studio 151 files by placing them in the config/composer/tracks/ directory and the plugin will automatically load them on start.

Composer comes with a full music player built in as shown below. There are commands for each action you can perform within this menu as well as the text itself being clickable.
